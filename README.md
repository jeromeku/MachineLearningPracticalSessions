# Machine Learning Practical Sessions

This repository gather almost all Machine Learning practical sessions I attended during my studies at the INSA of Rouen & the University of Rouen in 2013 and 2014.

## Organization

Each practical sessions consist of a folder containing the sources (that you should be able to run) and a report of the results as a PDF file.

Each sessions is numbered `x.y`, where `x` correspond to the number of the course, and `y` correspond to the number of the pratical session of the course.

## About the code

The code is either in Matlab (for the most part) or in Python (for a few ones).

For Matlab, the following libraries might be needed:

* [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) (very often)
* [SimpleMKL](http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/enseignants/~arakoto/code/mklindex.html) (very often for `monqp.m`)
* [PROPACK](http://sun.stanford.edu/~rmunk/PROPACK/) (rarely)
* [PRTools](http://prtools.org/) (very rarely)
* [SOM Toolbox](http://www.cis.hut.fi/somtoolbox/) (very rarely)

For Python you will need the `scipy` environment, `pickle`, `pykalman` and `yahmm`.
